How to run the code:

1. Build Docker Image by using the following command:

docker build -t <Docker Image Name>:<Version> .

2. Create a docker container:

docker run -p 5000:5000 <Docker Image Name>:<Version>

3. POST an image to the flask application programming interface:

curl -F "file=@<image path name/image name.jpg>" http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload

In our example:

curl -F "file=@images/fishy.jpg" http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload

The output of the above command will be in the form:

{'class_id': class_id, 'class_name': class_name}

In our example, the image is of a goldfish and the output given by the application is

{'class_id': "n01443537", 'class_name': "goldfish"}
